Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts.","PDGFR, Grb2, SOS, Ras, Raf, MEK1, ERK; VEGFR, PLC, PKC, Raf, MEK1, ERK","CCN2, TGFB1, FGF, FGFR, PDGF, PDGFR, VEGF, VEGFR, IL13, TGFB1, Grb2, Ras, Raf, MEK1, PIK3CA, PRKCA, PRKCQ, PRKCE",DOI: 10.1183/09031936.00174914

"NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3",Multiple cancers,,"Larotrectinib, Regorafenib, Entrectinib","Tropomysoin Receptor Kinases (TRK) like TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC elicit activities that regulate the natural growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons when they interact with endogenous neutrotrophin ligands. TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are themselves encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes, respectively. Larotrectinib functions as an inhibitor of TRKs including TRKA, B, and C. It has been discovered that chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of these genes with various partners, translocations in the TRK kinase domains, mutations in the TRK ligand-binding site, amplifications of NTRK, or the expression of TRK splice variants can result in constitutively-activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as oncogenic drivers that promote cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines.","NTRK1, IP3R; NTRK2, SHC1, GRB2, RAS, RAF1, MAP2K1/MAP2K2, MAPK3/MAPK1","PIK3R1, NFKB2, AKT, NTRK1, IP3R; NTRK2, SHC1, GRB2, RAS, RAF1, MAP2K1/MAP2K2, MAPK3/MAPK1",

Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential.","ATP1A1, CACNA1C, TNNC, MYL2","ATP1A1, CACNA1C, TNNC, MYL2",

It prevents these ligands to binding to endothelial receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to suppress neovascularization and decrease vascular permeability. This ultimately will slow vision loss or the progression of metastatic colorectal cancer.","VEGFA, VEGFR1/VEGFR2, TLR4, NFKB1, MCP1/CCL5","VEGFA, VEGFR1,VEGFR2, TLR4, NFKB1, MCP1, CCL5",

This results in the inhibition of the formation of thymidylate from uracil, which leads to the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death.","TYMS,P53/DUT","TK1, ABCC4, ABCG2, RRM1, RRM2, ABCC5, ERCC2, TDG2, XRCC3, SMUG1",

These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1. The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.
